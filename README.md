## Demo 1: Exception handling

In this demo we have gone through different kinds of exceptions and how we can use exceptions to our advantage and have a better understanding of what the flippin' heck our code is doing. We had two different demos, one demo for the Applied Computer Science and IT year study. And one for Computer engineering and IT students.

## Demo 2: classes and objects
---
In this demo, we aim to have a deeper understanding of how we can use classes and objects to our advantage. [Object Oriented code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/)  clean, reusable and robust code. We had two different demos, first for applied Computer science and IT years, and next week for IT and Engineering.
